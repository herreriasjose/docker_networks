Docker Networks
===================

Most applications today do not run in isolation. They need to communicate with other systems. If we want to run a website, a service or a database inside a Docker container, we first need to understand how to run a service and expose its ports to other applications.

Let's start with a simple example, and run an Nginx server:

```bash
$ docker run nginx
/docker-entrypoint.sh: /docker-entrypoint.d/ is not empty, will attempt to perform configuration
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Looking for shell scripts in /docker-entrypoint.d/
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh
10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh: info: Getting the checksum of /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh: info: Enabled listen on IPv6 in /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/20-envsubst-on-templates.sh
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/30-tune-worker-processes.sh
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Configuration complete; ready for start up
```
We can see the logs in the console and we know it is running. 

Nginx is a web application server whose user interface is accessible by default through port 80. Therefore, if we were to install Nginx on our machine, we could browse it at http://localhost:80. In our case, however, Nginx is running inside the Docker container.

This is because Nginx has been started inside the container and we are trying to reach it from the outside. How can we make the running Nginx accessible from the outside?

Let's start a new Nginx container by publishing port 80:

```bash
$ docker run -p 80:80  nginx
/docker-entrypoint.sh: /docker-entrypoint.d/ is not empty, will attempt to perform configuration
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Looking for shell scripts in /docker-entrypoint.d/
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh
10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh: info: Getting the checksum of /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
10-listen-on-ipv6-by-default.sh: info: Enabled listen on IPv6 in /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/20-envsubst-on-templates.sh
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Launching /docker-entrypoint.d/30-tune-worker-processes.sh
/docker-entrypoint.sh: Configuration complete; ready for start up
```

After a few seconds Nignx should have started and you should be able to access its welcome page via http://localhost:80:

This simple port mapping is sufficient for many common container use cases. We can then deploy a large number of services as Docker containers and expose their ports to facilitate communication.
